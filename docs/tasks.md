# AdventureMate Development Tasks

## Recent Updates

### Safety Alert Delete Functionality Fix (Latest)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Priority:** High

#### Issue Resolved:

- **Problem**: Safety alert deletion was failing with 404 errors when trying to delete campground-level alerts using campsite endpoints
- **Root Cause**: Frontend was using `entityType` prop to determine API endpoint instead of checking actual alert properties
- **Solution**: Updated delete function to check alert properties (`alert.campsite` vs `alert.campground`) and use appropriate endpoint

#### Technical Implementation:

- **SafetyAlertList.jsx**: Modified `handleDeleteConfirm` function to use same logic as `handleAcknowledgeAlert`
  - Check `alert.campsite` → use `/campsite-safety-alerts/{campsiteId}/safety-alerts/{alertId}`
  - Check `alert.campground` → use `/campgrounds/{campgroundId}/safety-alerts/{alertId}`
  - Fallback to original logic if neither exists
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logging for debugging alert properties and URL construction
- **Error Handling**: Improved error logging to show response status and data

#### Benefits:

- **Correct Endpoint Usage**: Alerts now use the appropriate API endpoint based on their actual type
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify endpoint selection issues
- **Consistent Logic**: Delete function now follows same pattern as acknowledge function
- **Improved Reliability**: Eliminates 404 errors for mixed alert types

#### Files Modified:

- `client/src/components/SafetyAlertList.jsx` - Updated handleDeleteConfirm function with alert property checking
- Enhanced error handling and debugging for safety alert operations

### Redis Configuration Fix (Latest)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Priority:** Medium

#### Issue Resolved:

- **Problem**: Docker container was connecting to Redis container instead of local Redis instance
- **Root Cause**: `REDIS_HOST=localhost` in Docker container refers to container itself, not host machine
- **Solution**: Updated Docker configuration to use `host.docker.internal` for local Redis connection

#### Technical Implementation:

- **docker-compose.override.yml**: Added `REDIS_HOST: host.docker.internal` to app service environment
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed Redis dependency from app service since using local Redis
- **Container Configuration**: App now connects to host machine's Redis instance instead of containerized Redis

#### Benefits:

- **Local Redis Usage**: Application uses existing local Redis setup instead of containerized version
- **Data Persistence**: Redis data persists across container restarts
- **Simplified Architecture**: No need to manage separate Redis container for development
- **Better Performance**: Direct connection to local Redis instance

#### Files Modified:

- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Added Redis host configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed Redis service dependency from app

---

### Profile Update Error Handling Fix (Latest)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Priority:** High

#### Issue Resolved:

- **Problem**: Profile update validation errors were showing generic "Request failed with status code 400" error page instead of field-specific error messages in the modal
- **Root Cause**: UserContext was setting global error state and re-throwing errors, causing them to bubble up to the error boundary
- **Solution**: Modified error handling to return error information instead of throwing, allowing local component handling

#### Technical Implementation:

- **UserContext.jsx**: Modified `updateProfile` function to return result objects instead of throwing errors
  - Success: `{ success: true, user: updatedUser }`
  - Error: `{ success: false, error: responseData, message: errorMessage }`
- **ProfilePage.jsx**: Updated `handleEditSave` to handle the new return format and display field-specific errors
- **Error Boundary**: No longer triggered for validation errors, only for unhandled errors
- **Modal Behavior**: Stays open on validation errors, closes only on successful updates

#### Benefits:

- **Better UX**: Users see specific error messages under relevant input fields
- **No Generic Error Pages**: Validation errors handled locally without triggering error boundary
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Follows the same pattern as other form validations in the app
- **Improved Debugging**: Clear separation between validation errors and system errors

#### Files Modified:

- `client/src/context/UserContext.jsx` - Updated error handling in updateProfile function
- `client/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx` - Modified handleEditSave to process error results
- Error handling now properly displays "Username is already taken" and other validation messages

- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Language switcher component with persistent language preference
- **Consistent Naming**: Translation keys follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., `auth.login`, `campgrounds.title`)
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to English for missing translations
- **Context-Aware Translations**: Support for interpolation and pluralization
- **Common Error Messages**: Centralized error message translations for consistency

#### Files Modified:

- **Frontend**: Updated `ClusterMap.jsx` popup logic to conditionally display pricing information
- **Logic**: Implemented ternary operator to check campsites array length and display appropriate message

#### Files Modified:
