# Server Startup Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing ECONNREFUSED errors when making API requests from the frontend to the backend:

```
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
[vite] http proxy error: /api/v1/auth/status
AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]: 
    at internalConnectMultiple (node:net:1122:18)
    at afterConnectMultiple (node:net:1689:7)
```

These errors occurred because the backend server was crashing during startup due to a reference error. The `convertSessionToJWT` function was being used before it was imported, causing the server to crash.

## Solution
The solution was to fix the order of imports in `app.js`:

1. Moved the import statement for the deprecation middleware from the bottom of the file to before it's used:
   ```javascript
   // Import deprecation middleware
   const { deprecateEndpoint: deprecateEndpointMiddleware, convertSessionToJWT } = require('./middleware/deprecation');
   ```

2. Renamed the imported `deprecateEndpoint` to `deprecateEndpointMiddleware` to avoid a naming conflict with the one imported from apiVersioning.

3. Updated all references to `deprecateEndpoint` in the route definitions to use `deprecateEndpointMiddleware` instead.

4. Removed the duplicate import statement that was previously at the bottom of the file.

## Why This Fix Works
JavaScript executes code sequentially, so variables and functions must be defined before they are used. By moving the import statement before the function is called, we ensure that the function is available when it's needed.

The renaming of the imported function helps avoid naming conflicts, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Additional Notes
- This issue was causing the backend server to crash during startup, which is why the frontend was unable to connect to it.
- The error was not immediately obvious because the server was crashing silently and then waiting for file changes to restart.
- Always check the order of imports and ensure that functions are defined before they are used.
- Using a linter like ESLint can help catch these types of errors before they cause runtime issues.
