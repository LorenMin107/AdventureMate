# Authentication Loop Fix

## Issue
When trying to log in or register, the pages kept logging in or registering themselves in an infinite loop. This was causing excessive API calls and preventing users from successfully authenticating.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `convertSessionToJWT` middleware in `middleware/deprecation.js`. This middleware is designed to detect session-based authentication and add JWT tokens to the response, which helps with the migration from session-based to JWT-based authentication.

However, the middleware was being applied to all routes, including the login and register routes. When a user tried to log in or register, the middleware would detect the session-based authentication and add JWT tokens to the response. This would cause the frontend to think the user was already authenticated, triggering another authentication check, which would again go through the middleware, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution
The solution was to modify the `convertSessionToJWT` middleware to skip conversion for login and register routes:

```javascript
const convertSessionToJWT = () => {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    // Skip conversion for login and register routes to prevent infinite loops
    if (req.originalUrl.includes('/login') || req.originalUrl.includes('/register')) {
      return next();
    }
    
    // Rest of the middleware...
  };
};
```

By skipping the conversion for these specific routes, we prevent the middleware from adding JWT tokens to the response during the login and registration processes, which breaks the infinite loop.

## Why This Fix Works
The fix works because it prevents the middleware from interfering with the normal authentication flow for login and register routes. These routes need to handle authentication themselves without the middleware adding JWT tokens to the response.

For all other routes, the middleware continues to work as intended, detecting session-based authentication and adding JWT tokens to the response to help with the migration to JWT-based authentication.

## Additional Notes
- This issue was part of the ongoing migration from session-based to JWT-based authentication.
- The middleware is still applied to all other routes, so the migration can continue as planned.
- This fix is a targeted solution for the specific issue and doesn't affect the overall migration strategy.
