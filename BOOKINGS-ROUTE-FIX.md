# Bookings Route Fix

## Issue
The application was crashing with the following error:
```
Error: Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]
    at Route.<computed> [as get] (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:216:15)
    at proto.<computed> [as get] (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:521:19)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/routes/bookings.js:6:8)
```

This error occurred because the route handler `bookings.viewBooking` in `routes/bookings.js` was undefined, even though the function is correctly defined in the `controllers/bookings.js` file.

## Solution
The solution was to define the route handler directly in the routes file, rather than referencing the controller function. This approach works around any issues with how the function is exported or referenced.

### Changes Made
In `routes/bookings.js`, I replaced:
```javascript
router.get("/view", isLoggedIn, addBookingCountToUser, bookings.viewBooking);
```

With:
```javascript
// Define the route handler directly to avoid undefined function issue
router.get("/view", isLoggedIn, addBookingCountToUser, async (req, res) => {
  // Call the viewBooking function directly
  return bookings.viewBooking(req, res);
});
```

## Why This Fix Works
By defining the route handler directly in the routes file, we ensure that Express receives a valid callback function. The new handler then calls the controller function directly, which should work even if there's an issue with how the function is exported or referenced.

## Possible Root Causes
While the fix addresses the immediate issue, the root cause could be one of the following:

1. **Module Loading Order**: JavaScript's module system can sometimes behave unexpectedly if there are complex dependencies or circular references.

2. **Code Execution Timing**: The controller function might not be fully defined when the route is being registered.

3. **Export/Import Mismatch**: There might be a subtle issue with how the function is exported from the controller and imported in the routes file.

## Additional Notes
If this issue occurs with other routes, the same approach can be applied: define the route handler directly in the routes file and call the controller function from within that handler.

To prevent similar issues in the future, consider:
- Using named exports instead of modifying the module.exports object
- Avoiding circular dependencies
- Using a more structured approach to defining routes and controllers
