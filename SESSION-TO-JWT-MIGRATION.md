# Session to JWT Migration - Phase 4: Session Removal

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to remove session-based authentication and fully migrate to JWT-based authentication as part of Phase 4 of the Session to JWT Migration Plan.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Session Configuration

- Removed express-session and connect-mongo imports
- Removed session store configuration
- Removed session middleware
- Removed session configuration options

### 2. Removed Passport Session Configuration

- Removed passport.session() middleware
- Removed passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser() functions
- Kept passport.initialize() for local strategy authentication

### 3. Removed Session Security Middleware

- Removed validateSession middleware
- Removed rotateSession middleware
- Removed session-based security checks

### 4. Updated Web Routes to Use JWT Authentication

#### User Routes (routes/users.js)

- Removed storeReturnTo middleware
- Removed passport.authenticate middleware
- Updated to use authenticateJWT middleware
- Modified controller functions to use JWT

#### Campground Routes (routes/campgrounds.js)

- Replaced isLoggedIn with authenticateJWT and requireAuth
- Replaced isAuthor with isAuthorJWT
- Replaced isAdmin with isAdminJWT

#### Review Routes (routes/reviews.js)

- Replaced isLoggedIn with authenticateJWT and requireAuth
- Replaced isReviewAuthor with isReviewAuthorJWT

#### Admin Routes (routes/admin.js)

- Replaced isLoggedIn with authenticateJWT and requireAuth
- Replaced isAdmin with isAdminJWT

### 5. Updated Controller Functions

#### User Controllers (controllers/users.js)

- Updated register function to use JWT tokens
- Updated login function to use JWT tokens
- Updated logout function to revoke JWT tokens
- Added cookie-based token storage for web routes

### 6. Created Web-Specific JWT Middleware

Created a new file `middleware/webJwtAuth.js` with the following middleware functions:

- isAdminJWT: Checks if user is an admin and redirects if not
- isAuthorJWT: Checks if user is the author of a campground and redirects if not
- isReviewAuthorJWT: Checks if user is the author of a review and redirects if not

### 7. Updated Middleware Functions

- Removed session-dependent middleware functions from middleware.js
- Updated API middleware functions to use JWT authentication

## Authentication Flow

### Registration

1. User submits registration form
2. Server creates a new user account
3. Server generates JWT tokens (access token and refresh token)
4. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
5. User is redirected to the campgrounds page

### Login

1. User submits login form
2. Server authenticates the user
3. Server generates JWT tokens (access token and refresh token)
4. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
5. User is redirected to the requested page or campgrounds page

### Logout

1. User clicks logout link
2. Server revokes the refresh token
3. Server clears the token cookies
4. User is redirected to the campgrounds page

### Protected Routes

1. User requests a protected page
2. Server extracts the JWT token from the cookie
3. Server verifies the token and identifies the user
4. If the token is valid, the user is granted access
5. If the token is invalid or missing, the user is redirected to the login page

## Testing

To ensure the migration was successful, test the following:

1. Registration functionality
2. Login functionality
3. Logout functionality
4. Protected routes (campgrounds, reviews, admin)
5. Authorization checks (author, admin)

## Phase 5: Cleanup

With the completion of Phase 4, the application has fully migrated from session-based authentication to JWT-based authentication. Phase 5 involves cleanup of deprecated code:

### 1. Removed convertSessionToJWT Middleware

- Removed the import of convertSessionToJWT from middleware/deprecation.js
- Removed the app.use(convertSessionToJWT()) line
- Removed the comments related to the convertSessionToJWT middleware

### 2. Removed Legacy API Routes

- Removed the imports of the legacy API routes
- Removed the app.use() calls that mount the legacy API routes
- Removed the deprecationOptions object and the deprecateEndpointMiddleware calls

### 3. Removed Session-Related Configuration

- Session-related configuration was already removed in Phase 4

### 4. Updated Documentation

- Updated this document to reflect the changes made in Phase 5

## Conclusion

The migration from session-based to JWT-based authentication is now complete, and all deprecated code has been removed. The application no longer relies on sessions for authentication, which improves scalability and security. All authentication is now handled using JWT tokens, with proper token management and security measures in place.
