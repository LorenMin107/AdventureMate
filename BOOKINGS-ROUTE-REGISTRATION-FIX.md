# Bookings Route Registration Fix

## Issue
The application was crashing with the following error:
```
Error: Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]
    at Route.<computed> [as get] (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:216:15)
    at proto.<computed> [as get] (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:521:19)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/liammin/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Codes/MyanCamp/routes/bookings.js:7:8)
```

This error occurred even though we had previously fixed the route handlers in `routes/bookings.js` by defining them directly in the file.

## Root Cause
After investigating the issue, we found that while the `bookingRoutes` were correctly imported in `app.js`, the line that registers these routes with the Express app was commented out:

```javascript
// app.use("/bookings", bookingRoutes);
```

This meant that the `routes/bookings.js` file was being loaded during the import process (which is why we were seeing the error), but the routes defined in it were not actually being registered with the Express app.

## Solution
The solution involved two parts:

1. **Keep the direct route handler approach**: We maintained our previous fix of defining all route handlers directly in the `routes/bookings.js` file, which ensures that Express receives valid callback functions for all routes.

2. **Uncomment the route registration**: We uncommented the line in `app.js` that registers the booking routes with the Express app:

```javascript
app.use("/bookings", bookingRoutes);
```

## Why This Fix Works
This fix works because:

1. By defining the route handlers directly in the routes file, we ensure that Express receives valid callback functions for all routes, avoiding the "undefined function" error.

2. By uncommenting the route registration line in `app.js`, we ensure that the routes defined in `routes/bookings.js` are actually registered with the Express app, allowing them to be used in the application.

## Lessons Learned
This issue highlights the importance of checking both the route definitions and how they're registered with the Express app. Even if the routes are correctly defined, they won't work if they're not properly registered.

It also demonstrates that errors can sometimes occur during the loading/parsing of files, even if those files aren't actively being used in the application. In this case, the error occurred when `routes/bookings.js` was loaded during the import, even though the routes weren't being registered with the app.

## Additional Notes
If you encounter similar issues in the future, consider checking:

1. Whether the route handlers are properly defined and exported
2. Whether the routes are properly imported and registered with the Express app
3. Whether there are any circular dependencies that might be causing issues
4. The order of imports and middleware registration, which can sometimes affect how routes are processed
