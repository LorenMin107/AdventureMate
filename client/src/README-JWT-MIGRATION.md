# Frontend JWT Migration

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Session Cookie Dependencies

In `client/src/utils/api.js`:
- Removed `withCredentials: true` setting which was used to include cookies in requests for session-based authentication
- This ensures that all API requests rely exclusively on JWT tokens for authentication

### 2. Updated API Endpoints

In `client/src/services/AuthService.js`:
- Updated `/users/status` endpoint to use `/auth/status` instead
- Updated `/users/register` endpoint to use `/auth/register` instead
- These changes ensure that all authentication flows use the JWT-based v1 API endpoints

## Testing Authentication Flows

After making these changes, it's important to test all authentication flows to ensure they work correctly with JWT-only authentication:

### Login Flow
1. Test regular login with username/password
2. Test login with two-factor authentication if enabled
3. Test social login (Google, Facebook) if implemented
4. Verify that the user is properly authenticated after login

### Protected Routes
1. Test accessing protected routes after login
2. Verify that the JWT token is properly included in API requests
3. Test accessing protected routes after refreshing the page
4. Verify that the authentication state is properly maintained

### Token Refresh
1. Test that the token refresh mechanism works correctly
2. Simulate token expiration and verify that the token is automatically refreshed
3. Verify that API requests continue to work after token refresh

## Next Steps

After completing the frontend migration to JWT-exclusive authentication, the next phase will be API Endpoint Consolidation:

1. Redirect all legacy API endpoints to v1 equivalents
2. Monitor usage of deprecated endpoints
3. Set a timeline for removing legacy endpoints

## Conclusion

The frontend has been successfully migrated to use JWT-exclusive authentication. All API requests now include JWT tokens in the Authorization header, and session cookies are no longer used for authentication.
