# Password Reset Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the password reset functionality in the MyanCamp application.

## Overview

The password reset functionality allows users to reset their password if they have forgotten it. The flow is as follows:

1. User clicks the "Forgot password?" link on the login page
2. User enters their email address
3. System sends an email with a password reset link
4. User clicks the link in the email
5. User enters a new password
6. System validates the password strength
7. System updates the user's password
8. User can log in with the new password

## Backend Implementation

### Models

- `PasswordResetToken`: Stores password reset tokens with expiration and usage tracking
- `User`: Updated to include password history for audit logging

### Controllers

- `requestPasswordReset`: Generates a token and sends an email with a reset link
- `resetPassword`: Validates the token and updates the user's password

### Utilities

- `generatePasswordResetToken`: Generates a secure token for password reset
- `verifyPasswordResetToken`: Verifies that a token is valid and not expired
- `validatePasswordStrength`: Ensures passwords meet security requirements
- `createPasswordChangeAuditLog`: Logs password changes for security auditing

## Frontend Implementation

### Components

- `ForgotPasswordPage`: Form for requesting a password reset
- `ResetPasswordPage`: Form for resetting a password with a token
- `LoginForm`: Updated to include a link to the forgot password page

### Features

- Email input validation
- Password strength validation with visual feedback
- Password requirements checklist
- Success and error messages
- Automatic redirection after successful password reset

## Security Considerations

- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens can only be used once
- Password strength requirements:
  - At least 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Password changes are logged for audit purposes
- For security reasons, the system does not reveal if an email exists or not

## Testing

To test the password reset functionality:

1. Click the "Forgot password?" link on the login page
2. Enter an email address and submit the form
3. Check the email for a reset link
4. Click the link and enter a new password
5. Verify that you can log in with the new password

## Error Handling

The system handles various error cases:

- Invalid or expired tokens
- Weak passwords
- Mismatched passwords
- Non-existent email addresses (without revealing this information)
