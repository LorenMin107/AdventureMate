# üèïÔ∏è Profile Bookings Section Removal

## Issue

The user profile page had a redundant "Bookings" section that was unnecessary since users can access their bookings directly from the navigation bar.

## Problem

- **Redundancy**: Users could access bookings from both the profile page and the main navigation
- **UI Clutter**: The profile page had too many sections, making it less focused
- **Poor UX**: Having the same functionality in multiple places creates confusion
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Duplicate code and translation keys

## Solution

Removed the bookings section from the profile page to streamline the user interface and eliminate redundancy.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProfilePage.jsx

**Removed:**

- Bookings navigation item from the sidebar
- Bookings content section
- BookingList component import
- BookingList component usage

**Before:**

```jsx
<li className={`profile-nav-item ${activeSection === 'bookings' ? 'active' : ''}`}>
  <span className="profile-nav-icon">üèïÔ∏è</span>
  <span>{t('profile.bookings')}</span>
</li>;

{
  activeSection === 'bookings' && (
    <div className="profile-section">
      <h2 className="section-title">{t('profile.myBookings')}</h2>
      <div className="profile-card">
        <BookingList initialBookings={userDetails?.bookings || []} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**After:**

- Bookings section completely removed
- Profile now has 3 focused sections: Personal Info, Security, Reviews

### 2. Translation Files

**Removed unused translation keys:**

**English (`client/src/locales/en/translation.json`):**

- `profile.bookings`: "Bookings"
- `profile.myBookings`: "My Bookings"

**Thai (`client/src/locales/th/translation.json`):**

- `profile.bookings`: "‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏á"
- `profile.myBookings`: "‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô"
